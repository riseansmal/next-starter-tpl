# Linting Code

## ðŸ“„ About

Linting is the process of running a program that will analyse code for potential errors. In the case of JavaScript,
itâ€™s incredibly useful for spotting little things that you might otherwise miss, such as using a variable before itâ€™s been defined,
using an out-of-scope variable, and passing the wrong number of arguments to a function.

### â†’ lint-staged

[Lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) is a tool that allows you to run linters on Git staged files. This means that only the files youâ€™ve changed will be linted.
Used together with [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky), it can prevent bad code from being committed and pushed.

**Config Structure:**

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ apps
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docs
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .eslintrc.js
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ lint-staged.config.js   # overwrite global lint-staged.config.js, custom eslint
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ web
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ .eslintrc.js
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ lint-staged.config.js   # overwrite global lint-staged.config.js, custom eslint
â”œâ”€â”€ packages
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ui
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ .eslintrc.js
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ lint-staged.config.js   # overwrite global lint-staged.config.js, custom eslint
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ lint-staged.common.js  # few common utils
â””â”€â”€ lint-staged.config.js  # base config to overwrite per apps/packages
```

### â†’ commitlint

[Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) is a tool that checks if your commit messages meet the [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0) format. Itâ€™s used in conjunction with [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to ensure that your commit messages are in the correct format before you push them.

We also use conventional commit to [generate changelog]() automatically. Check [Contributing]() section for more details.

**Example:**

We are using our own, shared config, installed as npm dependency - [@wayofdev/commitlint-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wayofdev/commitlint-config)

**Config Structure:**

```bash
.
â””â”€â”€ commitlint.config.js  # config extends @wayofdev/commitlint-config
```
